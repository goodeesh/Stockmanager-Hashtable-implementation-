Stock Manager

Stock Manager is a program that helps you manage your stock investments. It allows you to add, search, save, and load information about your stocks. You can also import data from CSV files, plot graphs of the stock prices, and back up your data to a file.
Getting started

To use the program, you will need to compile the source code using a C++ compiler. The program requires the following libraries:

    iostream
    fstream
    string
    filesystem
    algorithm
    vector
    sstream

To compile the code, run the following command in your terminal:

css

g++ -o stock_manager main.cpp Aktie.cpp Hashtable.cpp

This will create an executable file called "stock_manager" that you can run by typing:

bash

./stock_manager

How to use

When you run the program, you will see a menu with several options:

    Add a stock: allows you to add information about a new stock
    Search for a stock: allows you to search for information about a specific stock
    Import a CSV file: allows you to import data from a CSV file into the program
